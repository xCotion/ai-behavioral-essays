## Introduction: A Confession

I need to be upfront about something: this topic severely hurts my brain for two reasons:

1. Constant advancement
2. Best practices change frequently

I'm fully aware this essay is severely subjective and will likely be outdated in some way by the time you read it. It used to be that every time a new update or software came out, I got excited and eager to learn it. Now, daily, every time I see an update it gives me a wave of anxiety and overwhelm.

But here's what I've learned: **there are two ways to think about AI at a high level.**

**Option 1:** Assume AI will stay the same or progress slowly. If so, find what works now, apply it, and scale it.

**Option 2:** Always assume AI will improve. The best thing to do is proactively think about what will get better as model performance improves—don't stagnate. This means every model release you benefit and maintain a moat. The real labor becomes refining for each release to squeeze performance out of model features. Look for future-proof use cases.

**I'm firmly in camp 2.**

## Part 1: Common Mistakes When Using AI

This can be very subjective—there's no single answer for how you should use an AI. However, I often see people with little understanding of the underlying technology attempt tasks that are very doable, but struggle because they cannot communicate effectively.

I'll break mistakes into three categories:
1. **General mistakes** (apply to all AI usage)
2. **LLM-specific mistakes** (text-based models like ChatGPT, Claude)
3. **Image generation mistakes** (Midjourney, Flux, etc.)

---

### General Mistakes

#### Mistake: Using the Wrong Tool for the Job

This is like trying to take a bath in the sink. You're using the wrong interface for the issue.

**Examples of mismatched tools:**

| Task | Wrong Tool | Right Tool |
|------|------------|------------|
| Long-form document generation | ChatGPT chat interface | Claude with Projects or artifacts |
| Code execution and iteration | Any chat interface | Claude Code, Cursor, or similar |
| Image generation | Text-only LLMs | Midjourney, Flux, or similar |
| Bulk data processing | Chat interface | API with custom scripts or Claude Code |
| Real-time collaboration on code | Standard chat | IDE-integrated AI (Cursor, Copilot) |
| Research with citations | Generic chat | Claude with web search, or custom research tooling |

#### Mistake: Not Understanding the Context Window

**Before going deeper, understand what's happening when you use a model:**

When you send a prompt in a new conversation, the AI starts with very little context:

1. Your first message
2. System prompt (tells the model how to act—this is NOT the model itself)
3. Personalization layer (your custom instructions)

Each message is appended to the conversation history. When you send your third message, the AI actually receives all three messages plus its two previous responses as input.

**The priority hierarchy:** System prompt > Personalization > Your individual messages

This is why trying to get the model to act unethically usually fails—the system prompt overrides your personalization. It's also why important information should be restated or placed in system prompts/custom instructions, and why starting fresh conversations for new topics often works better than continuing old ones.

#### Mistake: Treating AI Output as Final

AI output is a draft, not a finished product. Common failure modes:
- Publishing AI-generated content without review
- Trusting AI-generated code without testing
- Acting on AI recommendations without verification

**The fix:** Build verification into your workflow. AI accelerates drafts; humans verify finals.

#### Mistake: Not Having an Evaluation Method

How do you know if AI output is good? Most people can't answer this question clearly.

**Simple evaluation framework:**
1. **Correctness:** Is the information factually accurate?
2. **Completeness:** Does it address the full scope of what you asked?
3. **Relevance:** Does it stay focused on your actual goal?
4. **Usability:** Can you use this output directly, or does it need significant rework?

If you can't evaluate the output, you probably shouldn't be using AI for that task—or you need to learn enough about the domain to evaluate it.

---

### LLM-Specific Mistakes

#### Mistake: Poor Prompt Engineering & Not Reading the Manual

**Models are unique with unique characteristics.** You don't have to use every model to understand its quirks, but the more you do, the better you'll get.

**Resources to understand model differences:**
- [designarena.ai](https://www.designarena.ai/) – LLM model performance for design (websites, images, 3D, etc.) [2026-CHECK: verify still active]
- [lmarena.ai](https://lmarena.ai/) – Test prompts against models concurrently [2026-CHECK: verify still active]
- [nof1.ai](https://nof1.ai/) – Models compete in trading competitions [2026-CHECK: verify still active]

**General model tendencies** (as of 2026):
- **Claude models (Claude 4.5 family):** Better for "real world work," writing, nuanced reasoning, following complex instructions, agentic tasks
- **GPT models (GPT-5 family):** Better for math, research, structured data tasks, function calling
- **Gemini models (Gemini 2.x family):** Strong at multimodal tasks, very large context windows
- **Different model families have different incentives baked into training**

This comes down to how these models approach problems and what patterns they predict, which comes down to the data and methods used during training.

**You should AT MINIMUM do the following:**

For whatever model you're using, read the provider's prompting guide:
- **Anthropic Prompt Engineering:** [docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering)
- **OpenAI Prompt Engineering:** [platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)

This can greatly improve any inputs you make to AI, even in the simplest forms.

#### Mistake: Vague or Ambiguous Prompts

**High-level thinking for every prompt:**

1. What's the goal I'm trying to achieve from this message specifically?
2. What would a person with zero knowledge of what I want need to know to get me what I want?
3. What did I already do or know that I don't want this "person" to waste time on?
4. Do I prefer a specific format for the response? (least important)

**The most important question:** "What would a person with zero knowledge of what I want need to know to get me what I want, and what do I already know that they shouldn't waste time on?"

This is where **high-fidelity context** comes in (covered in Part 3).

#### Mistake: Using Intelligence Without Effective Communication Patterns

You want to clearly have **SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)** for communicating with AI based on the task you're doing. Remove common AI characteristics and think about how the model should behave.

Here's an example I use across all my AI interactions:

**Custom Instructions:**

- Don't use Millennial or Corporate jargon
- **Write like you're talking to a competent adult** – Don't repeat their question back, don't patronize, don't add summary paragraphs that rehash what you already said
- **Don't be sycophantic or overly agreeable** – You can disagree, push back, or point out flaws in reasoning. Being helpful doesn't mean reflexively validating everything the user says
- **Skip the preamble and meta-commentary** – Don't announce what you're about to do ("Let me break this down"), just do it. Get straight to the point
- **Avoid hedge words and corporate jargon** – Cut out "delve," "leverage," "utilize," "navigate," "landscape," "it's worth noting," "it's important to remember." Use simple, direct language
- **Don't automatically format everything as lists** – Write in natural paragraphs for explanations. Lists should be the exception, not the default
- **Drop the cheerleading and over-apologizing** – Skip "Great question!", "Absolutely!", and excessive hedging with "perhaps," "might," "could potentially"

These instructions dramatically change output quality. The model goes from sounding like a corporate chatbot to sounding like a competent colleague.

#### Mistake: Not Iterating

LLMs are conversational. A single prompt rarely gets you the best result.

**Better approach:**
1. First prompt: Get a rough draft
2. Second prompt: Point out what's wrong or missing
3. Third prompt: Refine specific sections
4. Fourth prompt: Final polish

Think of it as a dialogue, not a command.

#### Mistake: Ignoring Temperature and Model Settings

If your tool allows it, understand what temperature does:
- **Low temperature (0-0.3):** More deterministic, consistent, "safe" outputs
- **High temperature (0.7-1.0):** More creative, varied, potentially less coherent

For business tasks requiring consistency, lower temperature is usually better. For brainstorming, higher temperature can help.

### Image Generation Mistakes

Working with cameras in my former job and post-production software—taking photos and videos of jewelry (which I'd argue is very hard to do on a budget)—taught me an extraordinary amount about what it takes to make good digital content. Working with AI to do the same has been even more difficult.

I could cherry-pick examples that are extremely easy and already surpass expert real-world photographers with simple prompts. But that's not the point.

I think people miss a lot of use cases for image models and don't fully understand where it currently is, what the future means, and how to use it effectively.

**Golden rule: If you can tell it's AI, it's bad—not production-ready** (unless you're deliberately bypassing typical authority filters, which we'll talk about in the authority decay section).

#### Mistake: Poor Context or Low-Fidelity Context

Most people have no understanding of how image models actually work, and some are different from others.

**Image models by nature are still prediction engines.** They predict patterns in images based on what they were trained on.

**How image generation products work:**

Many image products use a **prompt-expansion / prompt-rewrite layer** before the image generator. This layer is often LLM-based (or a smaller text model). It converts short prompts (e.g., "dog") into richer instructions covering style, composition, lighting, camera settings, and constraints.

**Reasons for this layer:**
- Improves output reliability
- Fills in missing or ambiguous details
- Enforces safety and policy constraints
- Standardizes inputs to the image model

**What is NOT guaranteed:**
- Some systems do not use an LLM—they rely on templates, tags, heuristics, or lightweight parsers
- Some pipelines pass text directly to the image model's text encoder with minimal modification
- Prompt rewriting may be optional or only applied when prompts are short or ambiguous

**Knowing this, it's best to still provide high-fidelity context** to get the closest thing to exactly what you want. This is where real-world experience with photography or editing helps.

If you understand how layers in editing software work, you can tell the model to do some pretty cool things—like make posters or certain images you'd think a human created due to complexity.

#### Mistake: Treating Image Prompts Like Text Prompts

Image models parse language differently than LLMs. What works for ChatGPT often fails for Midjourney.

**Key differences:**
- Image models weight early words more heavily
- Commas and sentence breaks matter differently
- Style keywords and technical terms have trained meanings
- Negative prompts (what to avoid) are often as important as positive prompts

#### Mistake: Not Learning the Tool's Vocabulary

Each image generator has terms that trigger specific aesthetics:

**Examples (Midjourney):**
- "cinematic lighting" → specific Hollywood-style lighting
- "8k" or "highly detailed" → emphasis on detail
- "trending on artstation" → particular polished digital art style
- "shot on Canon EOS R5" → photorealistic camera-like quality

**The fix:** Study what keywords produce which results. Build a personal library of effective terms.

#### Mistake: Expecting Precise Control

Current image models are not precise. You cannot easily:
- Place specific text accurately (though this is improving rapidly)
- Control exact positioning of elements
- Reproduce identical outputs reliably
- Get consistent characters across multiple images

**The fix:** Use image models for what they're good at (ideation, mood, general composition) and expect to iterate or use other tools for precision.

## Part 2: Failure Modes Taxonomy

Beyond individual mistakes, there are five structural ways AI deployments fail. Knowing these helps you diagnose problems and build more robust systems.

### 1. Specification Failure

**What it is:** The user can't specify what they want, even if the model is capable.

**Symptoms:**
- Outputs are technically correct but not what you needed
- You keep saying "not quite" without being able to articulate why
- Results vary wildly between attempts

**Root cause:** The problem isn't the model—it's the gap between what's in your head and what you can express in words.

**Fix:** High-fidelity context (covered in Part 3). More examples, more constraints, clearer success criteria.

### 2. Evaluation Failure

**What it is:** No reliable way to tell "good" from "sounds good."

**Symptoms:**
- You accept outputs that seem right but later turn out wrong
- You can't explain why one output is better than another
- Quality is inconsistent and you're not sure why

**Root cause:** Without domain expertise or clear metrics, you can't distinguish quality.

**Fix:** Either develop evaluation expertise, build automated checks, or don't use AI for that task.

### 3. Alignment/Goal Drift

**What it is:** The system optimizes the wrong proxy, especially in longer chains or autonomous workflows.

**Symptoms:**
- The AI technically followed instructions but missed the point
- Multi-step processes produce outputs that drift from original intent
- Optimizing metrics that don't actually matter

**Root cause:** AI optimizes for what you measure, not what you want. In longer chains, small errors compound.

**Fix:** Shorter feedback loops, human checkpoints, clear terminal conditions.

### 4. Security Failure

**What it is:** Prompt injection, data leakage, tool abuse, unauthorized actions.

**Symptoms:**
- AI takes actions you didn't authorize
- Sensitive data appears in outputs or logs
- Malicious inputs cause unexpected behavior
- AI calls tools in ways that create risk

**Root cause:** AI systems are susceptible to adversarial inputs, and tool access creates real-world blast radius.

**Fix:** Input validation, output filtering, strict tool permissioning, sandboxing, audit logging.

### 5. Institutional Failure

**What it is:** Organizations can't adopt because of governance, not technology.

**Symptoms:**
- Legal/compliance blocks deployment
- No clear ownership of AI decisions
- Liability concerns prevent action on outputs
- No audit trail, no approval workflow, no accountability chain

**Root cause:** The technology is ready; the organization isn't.

**Fix:** Build governance first. Audit trails, access controls, approval workflows, clear ownership. The boring stuff.

## Part 3: High-Fidelity Context

I like to think of **high-fidelity context as the blueprint for the result you're trying to produce.**

It's the difference between giving someone vague instructions and giving them everything they need to execute perfectly.

### Why This Matters

AI models are:
- **Non-deterministic:** Same input can produce different outputs
- **Context-dependent:** Quality of output depends heavily on quality of input
- **Token-limited:** Wasted tokens on discovering what you want = worse results

High-fidelity context solves all three problems by front-loading the information the model needs.

### Programmer Example

Let's say you're making front-end UI and want to use a style you previously made or something you're inspired by.

**Bad ways to get an LLM to reproduce it:**
- Send a screenshot alone
- Show the entire codebase without focus
- Explain style characteristics vaguely and try to get a reproduction

**Why these are bad:**
- AI models are non-deterministic
- Context is ambiguous
- Model wastes tokens discovering useful information

**Better way (high-fidelity context + tactics):**

You want to make a new repository with a style used elsewhere.

**Step 1: Extract CSS manually**
- Inspect element → HTML → Styles
- Copy the actual CSS

**Step 2: Focus on UI generation for a single page**

Prompt structure:
```
[IMAGE]

Here is the extracted CSS:
"""
[paste CSS]
"""

Help me rebuild the exact same UI design in a single HTML file.
In the repo root, create the file called UI.html
```

**Step 3: Correct early mistakes**
- Fix simple things like colors in the first HTML file
- Use this corrected version as reference for future generations

**Why this works:** You've given the model the actual source of truth (the CSS), not a description of it. You've reduced ambiguity to near zero. The model isn't guessing—it's executing.

**Recommended tool:** Claude Code handles this workflow well—it can view files, write code, run it, and iterate without you having to copy-paste between interfaces.

---

### Non-Programmer Example

You want a cake that tastes *exactly* like your favorite bakery's chocolate cake.

**Low-fidelity context (bad):**
- "Make it rich and not too sweet"
- A photo of the slice
- "It has dark frosting and moist crumb"

This forces guessing: ingredients, ratios, bake time, cocoa type, etc.

**High-fidelity context (good):**
- The bakery's ingredient list + nutrition label (gives ratio hints)
- Pan size + oven temp + bake time from similar recipes
- A close-up of crumb + frosting thickness
- Your constraints: "no nuts, 9-inch round, needs to travel 2 hours"
- A target outcome: "match texture (dense, moist), sweetness level, and frosting sheen"

The more specific your context, the less the AI has to guess—and the better the output.

---

### Image Generation Example

Let's say you own a meal-prep company and you need a picture of a meal with the word "FRESH" over it.

**Step 1: Create a subject**

**BAD:** "A picture of a bowl of vegetables"

**GOOD:**
```
A pristine ceramic bowl containing roasted sweet potato cubes,
steamed broccoli florets, and grilled chicken breast slices,
arranged intentionally.

Shot from 45 degrees above on a white marble countertop.
Natural window lighting from the left side.
Style: clean, professional food photography.
--ar 1:1
```

**Step 2: Create copy/composition separately**

**BAD:** "Put these words in this picture like a poster"

**GOOD:**
```
Create a 1:1 square composition (1080x1080px) where the text "FRESH"
is centered perfectly, with the meal image as background.

The text should be:
- Font: Clean sans-serif (Helvetica or similar)
- Size: Large, approximately 30% of frame width
- Color: White with subtle drop shadow
- Position: Exact vertical and horizontal center

The meal should be:
- Slightly blurred (depth of field effect)
- Positioned lower third of frame
- Lighting: warm, appetizing
```

**Step 3: Concatenate into 1 prompt (for refinement)**

Once you've generated individual elements successfully, you can combine the successful prompt elements into one comprehensive prompt for faster iteration.

---

### The High-Fidelity Context Checklist

Before prompting for any complex task, ask yourself:

1. **What does success look like?** (Describe the end state precisely)
2. **What constraints exist?** (Format, length, style, technical requirements)
3. **What context does the AI need that it doesn't have?** (Background, definitions, examples)
4. **What should be avoided?** (Negative constraints are often as important as positive ones)
5. **What examples can I provide?** (Reference material, similar outputs, templates)

---

## Part 4: Authority Decay and What It Means for Your Business

Authority isn't decaying because AI makes it *fakeable*—authority decays because AI makes it **abundant**.

When everyone can generate professional-looking content, credentials, and social proof instantly, the signal-to-noise ratio collapses.

**The problem isn't counterfeiting; it's signal saturation.**

So the real question isn't "how do we make ads hard to fake?" It's: **"What cuts through when nothing is scarce except attention and trust?"**

### When Authority Decays, Three Things Happen:

**1. Polish becomes table stakes**
- Good design and clean copy are now expected, not differentiating
- AI makes them abundant and cheap
- You can't win on polish alone anymore

I've seen this in my own business. A year ago, a clean website with professional copy was a signal of competence. Now everyone has that. The signal has shifted to things that are harder to fake: speed of response, depth of understanding in the first conversation, demonstrated results.

**2. People stop believing claims and start believing patterns**
- Not "who said it," but: *Do other people use it? Does it keep showing up? Can I try it fast?*
- Repetition and consistency matter more than single impressive claims
- Social proof becomes even more important (and more gameable)

**3. Trust shifts from institutions to stacks of signals**

Conversions happen when users get **at least 2 of these:**
- The platform shows it to them (algorithmic endorsement)
- Peers validate it (social proof—reviews, testimonials, word of mouth)
- They feel a fast win (experiential—free trial, demo, immediate value)
- There's visible recourse (enforcement, guarantees, refund policy)
- A real person is attached (identity stake—founder's face, real testimonials)

### What This Means for Your Business

**If you're relying on polish to differentiate:** That advantage is eroding. Invest in speed, distribution, and demonstrated results instead.

**If you're relying on credentials:** Credentials still matter, but less. Show outcomes, not certificates.

**If you're building trust:** Stack multiple trust signals. Don't rely on any single one.

**If you're competing with AI-generated content:** Compete on what AI can't fake easily—speed of response, human accountability, demonstrated track record, and personal relationships.

### Practical Adaptations I've Seen Work

1. **Faster response wins.** If you can respond to a lead in 5 minutes while competitors take 24 hours, that speed is a trust signal AI can't replicate (yet).

2. **Demonstrated, specific results.** Not "we increase conversions" but "we increased Client X's conversions from 2.1% to 4.8% over 6 months." Specificity is expensive to fake at scale.

3. **Founder/operator visibility.** When the person responsible has their face and reputation attached, that's accountability AI can't provide.

4. **Interactive proof.** Free tools, demos, calculators—anything that lets the prospect experience your value before committing.

**Important caveat:** We haven't fully reached a point where digital content is fully at parity with real-world productions. As the gap closes, this becomes more true. But the trend is clear, and the businesses that adapt early will have an advantage.

## Part 5: When NOT to Use AI

AI is not always the right tool. Knowing when to skip it is as important as knowing how to use it.

### When the ROI Doesn't Work

**Time cost of AI:**
- Prompting and iterating takes time
- Reviewing and correcting output takes time
- Learning the tool takes time

**Break-even questions:**
- Would it be faster to just do this myself?
- How many times will I repeat this task? (One-off tasks often aren't worth optimizing)
- Is the quality difference worth the time investment?

**Rule of thumb:** If the task takes less than 5 minutes manually and you'll only do it once, skip AI.

### When Human Judgment is Essential

AI is a prediction engine, not a judgment engine. Some decisions require:
- Ethical reasoning that accounts for your specific context
- Relationship knowledge that AI doesn't have
- Accountability that only a human can provide
- Domain expertise that you need to verify anyway

**Examples:**
- Final hiring decisions
- Legal strategy (get a lawyer)
- Medical decisions (get a doctor)
- Relationship-critical communications
- Anything where being wrong has severe consequences

### When AI Creates Liability

AI-generated content can create legal and reputational risk:
- **Copyright:** AI trained on copyrighted material; provenance is unclear
- **Defamation:** AI can generate false statements about real people
- **Professional liability:** AI advice in regulated fields (law, medicine, finance)
- **Contractual:** Representations made with AI-generated content are still your representations

**The rule:** If you would hire a professional for this task, AI is a draft assistant, not a replacement. You still own the output and its consequences.

### When Quality Matters More Than Speed

For some outputs, "good enough" isn't good enough:
- Brand-defining creative work
- High-stakes presentations
- Content that defines your reputation
- Anything facing sophisticated audiences who will notice AI patterns

### When AI Output is Wrong: Recovery Process

When AI gives you bad output (and it will), here's the recovery sequence:

1. **Catch it early.** Build verification into your workflow so you catch errors before they propagate.
2. **Diagnose the failure mode.** Was it specification failure (your prompt), evaluation failure (you didn't notice), or capability failure (the model can't do it)?
3. **Fix the source.** If it's specification, improve your prompt. If it's evaluation, improve your review process. If it's capability, use a different approach.
4. **Document for next time.** Keep a log of what went wrong and how you fixed it. This becomes your institutional knowledge.

Accountability doesn't disappear because AI was involved. If you publish something wrong, you published it. If you act on bad advice, you acted on it. AI is a tool; you're responsible for what you do with its output.

## Part 6: The Economics of AI Usage

Understanding costs is essential for sustainable AI adoption. Here's how to think about it.

### Token Costs and Pricing (2026 Landscape)

[2026-CHECK: Verify current pricing - these are directional]

API pricing has decreased significantly since 2024, but tokens still cost money. The basic math:
- **Input tokens:** What you send to the model
- **Output tokens:** What the model generates back (typically more expensive)
- **Context size:** Larger contexts = more input tokens per request

**Cost drivers:**
- Long system prompts multiply across every request
- Including full documents when you only need excerpts
- Regenerating outputs instead of iterating
- Using the most expensive model when a cheaper one would work

### Break-Even Thinking

For any AI-assisted task, calculate:

**Manual cost:** Your hourly rate x time to do it manually

**AI cost:** API cost + your time prompting + your time reviewing/fixing

If AI cost > manual cost, don't use AI for that task—or find a way to reduce the AI cost (better prompts, cheaper models, less iteration).

### When High-Cost Models Make Sense

- **High-stakes outputs:** Legal documents, financial analysis, anything where errors are expensive
- **Complex reasoning:** Multi-step problems, synthesis across many sources
- **Speed matters more than cost:** Time-sensitive decisions where faster = more valuable

### When Cheap/Fast Models Make Sense

- **Classification and routing:** Sorting, categorizing, simple decisions
- **First drafts:** Where you'll heavily edit anyway
- **High volume, low stakes:** Email templates, social posts, routine content
- **Experiments:** Testing whether an approach works before investing in quality

### The "Which Model When" Framework

| Task Type | Model Tier | Why |
|-----------|------------|-----|
| Complex analysis, synthesis | Top tier (Claude 4.5 Opus, GPT-5) | Accuracy matters most |
| Standard business tasks | Mid tier (Claude 4.5 Sonnet, GPT-5 Mini) | Good balance of cost/quality |
| Simple, high-volume | Fast tier (Claude 4.5 Haiku, etc.) | Cost efficiency at scale |
| Experimentation | Cheapest available | Just testing the approach |

## Part 8: Indirect AI—What You Don't See But Shapes Your Reality

Most people don't realize how much AI already shapes their decisions, even when they're not actively "using AI."

**You're influenced by AI in these ways most commonly:**

| Indirect AI Application | How It Affects You |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Feed ranking | Decides what you see first (shapes priorities) |
| Recommendations | Steers taste over time (feels personal, isn't) |
| Search result ordering | Shapes what you believe is relevant or true |
| Autocomplete and smart replies | Nudges wording and tone |
| Ad targeting | Filters which offers and ideas reach you |
| Dynamic pricing | Adjusts what you pay based on demand and behavior |
| Fraud and risk models | Approves or declines your transactions |
| Moderation and spam filters | Hides or downranks content you might otherwise see |
| Camera and photo "auto" features | Subtly edits reality before you see it |
| Maps and routing | Influences where you go and what you discover |
| ATS and resume screeners | Gatekeeps career access |
| Security systems (FaceID, suspicious login) | Controls access via trust scoring |

**Why this matters for your business:**

Even if you never touch ChatGPT, AI is shaping your world—and your customers' worlds. Understanding this helps you:
- Build products and marketing that work *with* these forces instead of against them
- Recognize how your customers are being filtered and nudged before they reach you
- Spot opportunities where AI creates friction you can remove

## Part 9: What to Watch For (Capabilities Coming Online)

These are areas where AI capability is improving rapidly. Some are production-ready now; others are close.

### Production-Ready Now (2026)

**1. Agentic Execution Loops**

This is autonomous loop pattern: instead of one prompt → one response, you get iterative execution until a stopping condition ("done," "tests pass," "no errors," etc.). The point is persistence + self-correction across many steps.

**Where it works well:**
- Quality enforcement loops (style checks, linting, policy validation)
- Operations and incident response (observe → hypothesize → test → patch → verify)
- Data integrity tasks (schema conformance, deduping, reconciliation, backfills)
- Compliance preparation (assembling evidence, cross-checking requirements, generating audit artifacts)
- Research loops with coverage targets

**Key limiter:** Verification and blast radius. Autonomous loops are powerful when "wrong" is cheap and detectable; dangerous when "wrong" is subtle and costly.

**Tool:** Claude Code handles this pattern natively.

**2. Multimodal reasoning (vision + text + code simultaneously)**
- Models can now analyze screenshots, understand the structure behind them, identify issues, and propose fixes in one pass
- Useful for UI review, document analysis, debugging visual outputs

**3. Long-context reliability (100k+ token windows)**
- Models can reliably reference and reason over entire codebases, document sets, or conversation histories
- The "lost in the middle" problem is largely solved for production use

### Coming Soon (Watch Closely)

**4. Real-time collaboration (agents that "work alongside" you)**
- Current: You prompt, it responds, you prompt again
- Coming: AI that watches you work, suggests improvements proactively, and executes multi-step tasks autonomously with check-ins

**5. AI-generated video at scale**
- Current: Impressive demos, improving consistency and controllability
- Coming: Businesses generating custom video ads, tutorials, and social content at the cost and speed of image generation

**6. Multi-agent coordination**
- Current: Single agents executing tasks
- Coming: Multiple AI agents coordinating on complex workflows, handing off between specialized capabilities

## Part 10: Categories That Will Define Business AI

These aren't just use cases—they're structural buckets that change how businesses operate:

1. **Verification and provenance systems:** Trust infrastructure, audit logs, citations, accountability chains
2. **Security and adversarial environments:** Prompt injection defense, data exfiltration prevention, tool permissioning
3. **Regulated decision pipelines:** Where adoption is gated by liability more than capability
4. **Workflow-native AI:** AI embedded where work happens, not in a separate chat interface
5. **Multi-agent coordination:** AI mediating between humans and teams, not just helping one user
6. **Compute and cost optimization:** Routing, batching, "which model when," unit economics as strategy
7. **Taste and direction as moat:** Humans as editors and curators; AI as infinite draft engine

## Part 11: Final Thoughts

The businesses that win with AI won't be the ones that use it the most—they'll be the ones that use it **most effectively.**

That means:
- Understanding the tools deeply (read the manuals)
- Providing high-fidelity context (blueprints, not vague instructions)
- Building systems and SOPs around AI (not one-off prompts)
- Knowing the failure modes and building around them
- Watching for authority decay and adapting trust signals
- Knowing when NOT to use AI (ROI, liability, judgment calls)
- Understanding the economics (costs, break-even, model selection)
- Staying future-proof by betting on capabilities that improve with each model release

**AI is not magic. It's a tool. And like any tool, the skill is in the wielding.**

# Defensibility and Moats in AI Work

_What actually protects your position when capability becomes abundant_

---

## Introduction: The Commoditization Problem

In [[Intelligence as a Commodity]], I argued that AI capability is becoming like water—abundant, cheap, and delivered through infrastructure you don't need to own. The faucet (your workflow) matters more than the water (the model). But this raises an uncomfortable question: if anyone can access the same intelligence, what's actually defensible?

The honest answer is less than you'd hope.

We've watched this movie before. Web development went from specialized skill to Squarespace template. Cloud computing went from competitive advantage to utility bill. "Digital marketing expertise" went from valuable to table stakes. Each time, the same pattern: capability commoditizes, early movers scramble, and defensibility shifts elsewhere.

AI is following the same trajectory, just faster. What took cloud computing a decade is happening in years. GPT-3 was impressive. GPT-4 was accessible. Now GPT-5, Claude 4.5 Opus, Gemini 2—capability is abundant. The "I use AI well" positioning has a half-life measured in months, not years.

This essay is about what remains when capability commoditizes. Where do moats actually form? What advantages compound rather than erode? And how do you build defensibility without deluding yourself about what's defensible?

The goal isn't pessimism—moats still exist. The goal is realism about which moats are real and which are wishful thinking dressed up as strategy.

## Part 1: The Trust Layer Is the Real Moat

Before diving into the standard moat taxonomy, I need to emphasize what I think most people miss: in AI work, **the trust layer is the primary moat**.

From [[Intelligence as a Commodity]]: "Abundant intelligence doesn't remove uncertainty. It moves the bottleneck to verification and responsibility."

This isn't abstract. Here's what it means for my business:

I build websites for local service businesses in Winnipeg. $800 for the site, $120/month for maintenance. The technical work—generating copy, building pages, optimizing for local SEO—AI can do most of it now. A motivated business owner with Claude Code could probably build something 70% as good as what I deliver.

So where's my moat?

It's not capability. It's not even "I'm faster with AI." My moat is that Dave the plumber trusts me to handle his web presence. He doesn't want to learn Claude Code. He doesn't want to verify AI outputs. He doesn't want to think about whether the generated content is actually accurate. He wants to call someone who handles it and takes responsibility.

**The trust layer includes:**

- **Accountability**: When something breaks, who fixes it? Who's on the hook?
- **Verification burden**: Who reviews AI output for accuracy before it goes live?
- **Relationship continuity**: Who remembers that Dave prefers "emergency service" over "24/7 availability" because of a bad experience with the previous provider?
- **Judgment about exceptions**: Who decides when the standard approach doesn't apply?

This is why the question "Can AI do what you do?" misses the point. The question is: "Can AI take responsibility for what you do?"

Currently, the answer is no. And that gap—between capability and accountability—is where real moats form.

## Part 2: Moat Taxonomy for AI Work

Not all moats are created equal. Some are granite, some are sand. Here's a taxonomy ordered by durability, with AI-specific applications.

### Trust Moats

Reputation, track record, and demonstrated reliability. In a world of abundant capability, trust becomes the constraint. This is the moat I emphasized above, and I put it first because I think it's underrated.

Trust moats take years to build and seconds to destroy. They're also hard to fake—you either have a track record or you don't.

**AI-specific application**: As AI makes output generation trivial, the verification bottleneck becomes the value layer. Who do you trust to apply AI to your medical records? Your finances? Your legal documents? Your business's public presence? The answer isn't "the AI"—it's the person or organization accountable for the AI's output.

### Data Moats

Proprietary data that others can't easily replicate. This includes unique datasets, customer interaction histories, domain-specific corpora, or feedback loops that generate training signal.

The key question: is your data _actually_ unique, or just _currently_ unique? If someone with money could recreate it in six months, it's not a moat—it's a head start.

**AI-specific application**: Data moats are strengthening in the AI era. Models are commoditizing, but what you feed them isn't. My Winnipeg-specific understanding of which neighborhoods are growing, which service businesses are thriving, what local SEO patterns work—this is data that OpenAI doesn't have and can't easily acquire.

### Distribution Moats

Audience, channels, and relationships that let you reach customers. In AI, distribution often matters more than intelligence (see [[AI and Attention Markets]]). A mediocre product with great distribution beats a great product with no distribution.

But distribution moats require maintenance—audiences atrophy, algorithms change, relationships fade.

**AI-specific application**: As AI-generated content floods every channel, distribution moats become more valuable, not less. Everyone can produce content now. Few can get it in front of the right people. This essay collection is partly a distribution moat—it's findable, shareable, and demonstrates capability to potential clients.

### Workflow Moats

Embedded processes and switching costs. When your AI solution is deeply integrated into a customer's operations, switching is painful regardless of whether a better option exists.

**AI-specific application**: This is where "faucet building" from [[Intelligence as a Commodity]] becomes competitive advantage. When I'm not just delivering a website but managing the entire web presence workflow—content updates, review responses, GBP posts, analytics—switching requires the client to either learn all that or find someone else who understands their business.

### Expertise Moats

Judgment, taste, and domain knowledge that AI amplifies rather than replaces. This is the "context is king" principle applied to competitive advantage.

Deep expertise in a domain lets you ask better questions, catch AI errors, and know when to override. But expertise moats erode if the domain itself gets commoditized.

**AI-specific application**: The expertise that matters is shifting. "Knowing how to build a website" is commoditizing. "Knowing what a roofing company in the Midwest needs on their website to convert leads" is expertise that AI amplifies. Domain knowledge + AI fluency = compounding advantage.

### Network Moats

Effects that grow with scale—more users make the product better for all users. True network effects in AI services are rarer than people claim. Most "network effects" are actually just economies of scale in disguise.

**AI-specific application**: The honest truth is that most individual AI practitioners and small agencies don't have network effects. We have relationships (different thing), referrals (different thing), and maybe economies of learning (each project makes you better). Don't confuse these with genuine network effects.

### Moat Assessment Matrix

|Moat Type|Time to Build|Durability|AI Era Relevance|
|---|---|---|---|
|Trust|Very Long|High|Increasing (verification gap)|
|Data|Medium|High (if unique)|Increasing (models commoditizing)|
|Distribution|Long|Medium|Increasing (content abundance)|
|Workflow|Medium|Medium-High|Stable|
|Expertise|Long|Medium|Shifting (domain > technical)|
|Network|Long|Very High|Rare for small players|

The matrix reveals something uncomfortable: the most durable moats take the longest to build. There's no shortcut to trust, no hack for genuine network effects. If you're optimizing for speed, you're probably building in sand.

## Part 3: What's NOT Defensible (Brutal Honesty)

Let's be direct about what moats people claim that are actually fake or rapidly eroding.

### Already Commoditized (Not Moats)

**"I know how to prompt well."** This was defensible in 2023. It's not now. Anyone with a weekend can learn to get good outputs. The prompting tutorials are everywhere. If your entire value proposition is "I get better outputs from ChatGPT," you have maybe 6-12 months before clients realize they can too.

**"I built an AI wrapper."** Unless that wrapper has proprietary data, deep workflow integration, or a distribution channel competitors can't access, it's a feature waiting to be absorbed by the base model's interface. The graveyard of 2023 AI startups is full of wrappers.

**"I understand AI and my clients don't."** This knowledge gap is closing fast. Your clients are using AI now. They're reading about it. Their kids are showing them things. "AI literacy as moat" has a shelf life.

**"I'm 3x more productive with AI."** So is your competition. Productivity gains from AI are real but symmetric—everyone gets them. Being 3x more productive is table stakes, not advantage.

### Commoditizing Now (12-24 Month Shelf Life)

**"I can build agents."** Agent frameworks are proliferating. Claude Code, AutoGPT descendants, LangChain and similar—the tooling is getting accessible. The skill of "building agentic workflows" is following the same curve as "building websites" in 2005. Still valuable now, commodity soon.

**"I can fine-tune models for specific domains."** The tools are getting easier. The cost is dropping. Unless you have proprietary data to fine-tune on, this becomes a service anyone can offer.

**"I can build multi-agent systems."** See [[Multi-Agent Network Orchestration]]. The patterns are becoming documented. The frameworks are maturing. This is expertise with a time limit.

### What Actually Remains Scarce

**Judgment about when and how to apply AI.** This requires domain expertise + AI fluency + business acumen. It's not teachable in a weekend.

**Accountability and risk-bearing.** Someone has to stand behind the output. AI doesn't sign contracts or answer angry phone calls.

**Relationships with risk-averse customers.** Enterprise clients, regulated industries, anyone who can't afford AI errors—they buy trust, not capability.

**Speed of learning.** Not what you know now, but how fast you integrate new capabilities as they emerge. This compounds and is very hard to replicate.

---

## Part 4: Building Compounding Advantages

The best moats aren't static—they get stronger with use. Here's what actually compounds:

### Learning Loops

Every interaction should make your system smarter. Not in a vague "we're collecting data" sense, but in a concrete feedback loop: customer uses product → you observe outcome → you improve product → customer gets better results.

From my business: every local business website I build teaches me something about what works for local SEO in Manitoba. Every client interaction reveals a pattern. After 30+ projects, I have intuitions that can't be easily transmitted or replicated. This is a compounding advantage that AI accelerates—more projects, more learning, faster iterations.

The key is closing the loop. Most people collect data but never systematically learn from it.

### Cumulative Reputation

Trust accrues. Every successful project, every accurate prediction, every customer who vouches for you—these stack. Reputation compounds because it reduces customer acquisition cost over time.

The catch: one catastrophic failure can wipe out years of accumulation. Compounding works in both directions.

### Client Context Accumulation

The more you work with someone, the more context you have. This creates genuine switching costs—not artificial lock-in, but real accumulated understanding.

After maintaining a client's website for a year, I know: their tone preferences, their seasonal promotions, which services they want to emphasize, what questions their customers ask, and the competitive dynamics in their specific neighborhood. A new provider would take months to accumulate this context. That's a moat—and one that AI can't easily replicate because it's relationship-based, not data-based.

### Speed Advantages That Compound

In algorithmic trading (another domain I work in), there's a concept of "edge decay"—any advantage you find gets competed away over time. The response isn't to find a permanent edge; it's to find edges faster than they decay.

AI work is similar. The advantage isn't knowing something competitors don't. It's learning new things faster than they do. Every new model release, every new capability, every new tool—how quickly can you integrate it and apply it? This compounds because learning speed itself improves with practice.

## Part 5: The Small Market Moat

Here's a contrarian take: for many of us, obscurity is the moat.

I serve local service businesses in Winnipeg. This is not a market that venture-backed AI startups are targeting. The total addressable market is maybe a few thousand businesses. The revenue ceiling is too low to attract serious competition from well-funded players.

**Small markets have real advantages:**

- Competition doesn't scale down to you
- Local relationships matter more than technology
- Word-of-mouth in tight-knit communities creates distribution
- The economics don't support sophisticated competition

The honest assessment: most of us are in smaller markets than we admit. The fantasy of needing to defend against Google probably isn't your real competitive landscape. A more realistic threat model focuses on: local competitors, DIY alternatives, and client cost-sensitivity.

If you're operating in a niche that's valuable to you but not valuable enough to attract well-funded competitors, defensibility is less critical. The obscurity _is_ the moat.

## Part 6: Switching Costs and Lock-In (Ethical vs. Manipulative)

Switching costs are morally neutral until they're not. The line is whether you're creating genuine value that happens to be sticky, or creating artificial friction that traps people.

### Ethical Switching Costs

- Deep integration with customer systems (they'd lose functionality)
- Accumulated context and customization (they'd lose personalization)
- Training and expertise in your platform (they'd lose efficiency)
- Genuine relationships with your team (they'd lose trusted advisors)

These switching costs serve customers. They're high because you've created real value that takes time to recreate, not because you've built walls.

### Manipulative Lock-In

- Data hostage (exports are "coming soon" forever)
- Proprietary formats with no interoperability
- Artificial complexity that requires your support
- Contracts that punish leaving more than they reward staying

These switching costs exploit customers. They're high because you've deliberately made leaving painful, not because staying is genuinely better.

### The Integration Depth Test

Deeper integration creates higher switching costs. This is a feature, not a bug—if the depth creates value. The honest question: if a competitor offered free migration support and six months of discounted service, would your customers switch?

If yes, your moat is shallow. If they'd still hesitate because of accumulated value, your moat is real.

For AI services: integrate at the workflow level, not just the output level. Don't just deliver AI-generated content—embed into the content workflow, the review process, the publishing system. Make your AI service part of how they work, not just something they use.

---

## Part 7: Open Source vs. Proprietary Strategy

The question of what to share and what to protect is strategic, not moral. Both approaches can create value; both can be executed well or poorly.

### When to Share

Open distribution when:
1. Your moat is elsewhere (trust, service, integration)
2. Adoption grows the pie faster than it divides your slice
3. Community feedback improves your core offering
4. Transparency builds trust that closed approaches can't

This essay collection is an example. I'm sharing frameworks and thinking publicly because: the content establishes expertise (trust moat), attracts potential clients (distribution moat), and improves through feedback. The moat isn't the content—it's the demonstrated judgment and the relationships that form around it.

### When to Protect

Proprietary makes sense when:
1. The IP is your actual moat
2. Competitors could directly copy and compete
3. The value is in the specific implementation not the approach
4. Customers are paying precisely for exclusivity

The mistake is protecting commodities. If your "secret sauce" is something any competent person could recreate in a week with access to the same tools, protection buys you nothing but the illusion of security.

### For AI Services Specifically

Share your methodology (it builds trust and filters for sophisticated clients). Protect your specific integrations, customer data, and accumulated context (that's where genuine value lives).

My prompt templates, workflow approaches, and frameworks for local business websites—I'll share those. My client-specific configurations, accumulated context about each business, and the relationships themselves—those stay private.

## Part 8: Personal Moat Strategy

Theory is useless without application. Here's a framework for assessing and building your own defensibility.

### Personal Moat Assessment Template

|Moat Type|What I Have|Strength (1-10)|Evidence|
|---|---|---|---|
|Trust||||
|Data||||
|Distribution||||
|Workflow||||
|Expertise||||
|Network||||

Be honest. "I have a Twitter following" doesn't count as distribution if that following doesn't convert to customers. "I understand AI well" doesn't count as expertise if it's not demonstrably deeper than your competitors.

### My Own Moat Inventory (For Transparency)

|Moat Type|What I Have|Strength|Evidence|
|---|---|---|---|
|Trust|Local reputation in Winnipeg, essay track record|6/10|Repeat clients, referrals, published work|
|Data|Winnipeg-specific local business patterns|5/10|30+ projects, patterns I can articulate|
|Distribution|Essay collection, local network|5/10|This content, word-of-mouth|
|Workflow|Deep integration with client operations|7/10|Maintenance contracts, accumulated context|
|Expertise|Local SEO + AI fluency + business judgment|6/10|Demonstrable in work output|
|Network|Minimal|2/10|Not a realistic moat for my scale|

**What I'm actively building:** Trust and expertise through this essay collection and consistent delivery. Workflow moats through deep integration with clients.

**What I'm not optimizing for:** Data moats (don't have proprietary datasets at scale), network effects (market is too small), or aggressive lock-in (conflicts with values).

### 90-Day Moat Building Actions

For each prioritized moat, define concrete actions:

- **Trust**: Ship quality work consistently. Document outcomes. Ask for testimonials. Make track record visible.
- **Data**: Systematize what you're learning. Create internal knowledge bases. Notice patterns across projects.
- **Distribution**: Create content that demonstrates capability. Be findable for your target market.
- **Workflow**: Go deeper with existing clients rather than wider with new ones. Make yourself hard to replace through accumulated context.
- **Expertise**: Invest in the domain knowledge that AI amplifies. For me: local business dynamics, not AI prompting.

### Moat Maintenance Schedule

Moats erode. Distribution moats erode fastest (algorithms change, attention shifts). Expertise moats erode as domains evolve. Even trust moats decay without reinforcement.

Build maintenance into your operating rhythm:
- Monthly: attention to distribution (content, visibility)
- Quarterly: expertise development (learn something new in your domain)
- Continuously: trust-building through delivery

---

## Part 9: Moats and Money

Let me be direct about how moat thinking affects actual business decisions.

### Pricing Power

Moats determine pricing power. If you have no moat, you compete on price. If you have strong moats, you compete on value.

My $800 website price is sustainable because of trust moats (clients know me, know I'll deliver) and workflow moats (they don't want to learn this themselves). A commodity provider competing on pure AI capability would need to charge less and acquire customers more expensively.

### Client Selection

Moat thinking should inform who you work with. The best clients for moat-building are:

- Long-term orientation (workflow moats require time)
- Willingness to integrate deeply (not just one-off projects)
- Value trust over price (willing to pay for accountability)
- Located in your actual market (geographic moats matter for local businesses)

### Investment Decisions

Where should you spend time and money? Moat analysis gives clear answers:

- Time building trust (delivering quality work, accumulating track record) = high ROI
- Time learning the latest prompt tricks (commoditizing fast) = low ROI
- Money on tools that enable deeper client integration = defensible
- Money on tools that just make you faster = non-defensible (competitors get the same tools)

### When to Walk Away

Moat analysis also tells you when to exit:

- When your moat is eroding faster than you can rebuild
- When the market shifts and your accumulated advantages become irrelevant
- When competitors have developed moats you can't match

This isn't pessimism—it's capital allocation. Better to redeploy resources than defend an indefensible position.

## Conclusion: Build the Faucet, But Know Which Parts Matter

The uncomfortable truth about moats in AI work is that most of what feels defensible isn't. Capability commoditizes. Prompting skills commoditize. Even "understanding AI" commoditizes. What remains is judgment, trust, distribution, and accumulated advantage—the slow, unsexy work that compounds over years.

The AI era doesn't eliminate moats—it shifts where they form. When the water (capability) becomes abundant and cheap, the moat moves to:

- Who controls the faucet (workflow integration)
- Who trusts the faucet operator (trust and accountability)
- Who the faucet reaches (distribution)
- What flows through the faucet (proprietary data and context)

Build your faucet. But know which parts of the faucet actually matter.

For most of us in AI services, the answer is simpler than we want to admit: **do good work for people who trust you, accumulate context that's hard to replicate, and build relationships that survive technological change**. That's not a sexy moat strategy. But it's a real one.

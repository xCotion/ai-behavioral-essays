# How AI Can Help in Relationships

_Using prediction engines to understand people—including the parts you're not supposed to say out loud_

---

## Introduction

I commonly see people with little understanding of AI have these little "aha" moments—and I want this essay to be one of them.

Let me start off by saying: I am not a doctor, expert in human psychology, or a self-proclaimed AI expert.

This essay is meant to show the potential for AI—aka prediction engines, as I like to call them—in its ability to understand semantics, and how that translates into deciphering human behavior.

**A critical clarification:** How you use AI in this context is important. It's not meant to replace a human or be a final answer. But when there is no one to turn to, or options are limited, this can make or break a situation.

## Part 1: What This Actually Means

When I say "relationships," I mean all types:
- Interpersonal (family, friends, romantic partners)
- Social (acquaintances, community, networks)
- Business (colleagues, clients, partners)

The context matters because the goals are different:
- With family, you might want understanding and repair
- With clients, you might want to close a deal
- With friends, you might want to defuse a tense situation
- Socially, you might want to become closer to someone—or gain leverage

I'm going to be honest about that last one. "Gain leverage" sounds manipulative, and it can be. It can also mean understanding what someone actually needs so you can provide it. The tool is the same; the intent differs. I'll address this directly later.

## Part 2: The Core Capability

**The power comes from using AI to take the perspective of another person based on data points you've collected from previous interactions—or based on the general nature of someone in their position.**

You describe a person—their behaviors, statements, patterns, context, situation—and ask AI to model their perspective. You are effectively modeling this person as context, with the goal of understanding them better.

The AI generates hypotheses about:
- What they might be thinking
- What motivates their behavior
- What fears or concerns they might have
- What patterns explain their actions
- What triggers cause certain reactions

You will be very surprised what can happen.

I've used this to understand why a client was stalling (it wasn't the price—it was internal politics), why a family conversation kept going sideways (I was triggering something I didn't realize), and how to approach someone about a sensitive topic (the framing mattered more than the content).

## Part 3: How to Do It

### Gather Data Points

Before engaging AI, collect information about the person:

**Direct observations:** Things they've said (exact quotes when possible), actions they've taken, how they respond to specific situations, what topics make them animated or defensive, their communication patterns.

**Contextual information:** Their role and responsibilities, pressures they're under, what they're accountable for, their history with the topic at hand.

**Relationship context:** Your history with them, how they've responded to you specifically, points of connection or friction.

### Present Context to AI

Frame the situation clearly:

```
I need help understanding someone's perspective.

Here's what I know about them:
- [Role/position]
- [Recent behaviors or statements]
- [Patterns I've noticed]
- [Relevant context about their situation]

Here's the situation:
[Describe what happened or what you're navigating]

Questions:
- What might be motivating their behavior?
- What concerns might they have that I'm not seeing?
- How might they interpret my actions so far?
```

### Iterate and Challenge

Don't accept the first response as complete:
- Ask for alternative explanations
- Request the least charitable interpretation (what if you're wrong about them?)
- Ask what data would change the analysis
- Push back if something doesn't match what you know

### Apply with Judgment

AI output is a hypothesis, not certainty. Use it to prepare for conversations, consider angles you hadn't thought of, and develop empathy for positions you find frustrating. Never treat it as definitive truth about another person.

## Part 4: Use Cases

### Business: Uncovering Closing Conditions

**Situation:** A potential client keeps stalling on a decision.

**Approach:** Describe their stated objections, patterns of delay, their company context, their role and incentives. Ask what might actually be blocking the decision that they haven't articulated.

**What you might discover:** The real blocker isn't what they're saying—it could be internal politics, budget timing, fear of making the wrong choice, or a stakeholder you haven't met. This is directly money-relevant: understanding the actual objection lets you address it.

### Interpersonal: Understanding Difficult Dynamics

**Situation:** A family member keeps reacting negatively to a topic you bring up.

**Approach:** Describe the pattern and specific reactions, provide context about their history and values, ask what this topic might trigger for them that you're not seeing.

**What you might discover:** Your framing unintentionally touches on something sensitive—their sense of competence, past failures, or values they feel judged on. Knowing this lets you reframe.

### Social: Defusing or Gaining Ground

**Situation:** A friend seems upset but won't say why. Or: you want to get closer to someone in your network.

**Approach:** Describe the behavior change, recent context, what's been happening in their life (for defusing). Or describe what you know about them, shared interests, their goals and pressures (for connection).

**What you might discover:** Whether something is about you, about something else in their life, or about accumulated small things. For connection, what they might actually value from you vs. what you assumed.

## Part 5: The Honest Part About Ethics

Let me be direct: the same tool that helps you understand people better can also help you manipulate them. I mentioned "gain leverage" earlier because the original thinking on this topic included it—and I'm not going to pretend that's not a real use case.

Here's the spectrum:

**Understanding (generally ethical):** You learn a client is worried about looking bad to their boss. You address that concern directly, help them look good, and both of you benefit. You understood their actual need and served it.

**Manipulation (generally unethical):** You learn someone is insecure about a topic and deliberately use that insecurity to make them comply with something they wouldn't otherwise agree to. You exploited a weakness for one-sided gain.

**The middle (where most situations live):** You understand someone's pressure points and use that to structure a conversation more favorably. Is that understanding or manipulation? Depends on whether the outcome serves both parties or just you.

I'm not going to moralize about which uses are acceptable. I will say: if you'd be uncomfortable with someone using this approach on you, reconsider using it on them. And if you're using AI to model people primarily to extract value from them, that says something about your relationship patterns worth examining.

## Part 6: When This Fails (And When You're the Problem)

AI perspective-taking is only as good as your data—and it has real limitations.

### Incomplete Information

If you're missing key context, AI fills gaps with assumptions. Those assumptions may be wrong. They may not know about pressures from other relationships, cultural factors, or how they interpret your actions (which may differ wildly from your intent).

**Ask AI:** "What information would change this analysis?"

### Projection and Self-Deception

Here's the uncomfortable one: **if you describe someone filtered through your own biases, AI reflects those biases back.**

You can accidentally build a model of how you see them, not how they actually are. And AI will happily confirm your narrative. If you're the difficult one in the relationship, AI won't tell you unless you specifically ask.

**Force yourself to ask:** "What's the interpretation where I'm the problem? What would this look like if my assumptions about them are wrong?"

### Unpredictable People

Some people don't fit patterns. Mental health issues, crisis situations, or simply unusual personalities can make prediction unreliable.

**Hold conclusions loosely.** Be prepared to be completely wrong.

### Using This to Avoid Real Conversations

Sometimes modeling someone is procrastination from having the actual conversation. If you've run the same scenario through AI five times with minor variations, you're probably avoiding something.

## Part 7: When There's No One Else

Sometimes you're in a difficult situation and have no one to turn to—no therapist, no advisor, no trusted friend available at that moment.

AI can help as an interim tool:
- Point you toward helpful frameworks and resources
- Help you think through what you're experiencing
- Suggest types of professionals who might help
- Be available 24/7 when human support isn't

**Important limitations:**
- AI is not a therapist
- AI cannot diagnose or treat
- AI should not replace professional help for serious issues
- AI may miss warning signs that a trained human would catch

If the problem is mental health related, AI can point you toward helpful resources—either to learn more or to find professional help. For serious issues, that's where you should end up.

AI can bridge you to a better moment. It should not be your long-term solution for serious mental health concerns.

## Part 8: Templates

### Understanding Someone's Perspective

```
I'm trying to understand someone better.

About them:
- Their role/relationship to me: [describe]
- Key things they've said or done recently: [specific examples]
- Patterns I've noticed: [behaviors, reactions]
- What I know about their situation: [pressures, goals, history]

The current situation:
[What's happening]

What I want to understand:
- What might be driving their behavior?
- What concerns might they have that I'm not seeing?
- How might they be interpreting my actions?
```

### Preparing for a Difficult Conversation

```
I need to have a conversation with someone about [topic].

About them: [context]

My goal: [what outcome I'm hoping for]

My concerns: [what I'm worried might happen]

Help me:
- Anticipate their likely reactions
- Identify the best way to frame this
- Prepare for objections they might raise
```

### Challenging Your Own Narrative

```
I've been having friction with someone and I want to check my assumptions.

Here's my interpretation of the situation: [your view]

Here's what I know about them: [facts, not interpretations]

Help me:
- Identify what I might be getting wrong
- Generate the interpretation where I'm the difficult one
- Find what data would prove my interpretation wrong
```

## Part 9: Tools

For one-off perspective-taking, Claude or ChatGPT work fine. For more systematic work—tracking patterns across interactions, building persistent context about key relationships, or iterating on approaches over time—you might build simple tracking documents or use Claude Code to maintain structured context files.

For high-stakes situations, AI is a thinking partner, not a decision-maker. Get human input too—a therapist, mentor, trusted friend, or advisor.

---

## Conclusion

AI as a perspective-taking machine is powerful and underutilized. It can help you understand people you're struggling to connect with, prepare for difficult conversations, navigate complex relationship dynamics, and develop empathy for positions you find frustrating.

It can also help you gain leverage, close deals, and navigate social situations more effectively. That's the honest version.

The risks are real: you might confirm your own biases, avoid real conversations, or use understanding as a weapon. The tool is neutral. What you do with it says more about you than about AI.

Used thoughtfully, this makes you better at relating to others. Used carelessly, it makes you worse—more confident in wrong conclusions, more detached from genuine connection, more skilled at manipulation without the wisdom to know when not to use it.

You will be very surprised what can happen. Make sure you're surprised in the right direction.
